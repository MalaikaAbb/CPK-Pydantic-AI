          A frontend tool, <code>approve_governed_action</code>, that pauses
          the run on an approval card before a side effect. The card shows the
          action, the tool, its reference and the exact arguments. It acts on
          the verdict: <code>allow</code> resolves on its own,{" "}
          <code>deny</code> blocks, and <code>require_approval</code> waits for
          Approve or Reject.

            The page publishes no policy engine, no agent and no{" "}
            <code>executeSideEffect</code>. The demo runs on the Quickstart
            agent (<code>my_agent</code>, whose only instruction is &ldquo;Be
            fun!&rdquo;), so <code>id</code>, <code>reference</code> and{" "}
            <code>verdict</code> are whatever the model puts in the tool call.
            The approval mechanism is real, but the decision it gates is
            invented.

                two unstyled buttons (the doc gives them no classes). The run
                waits. Approve or Reject resumes it, and the agent replies based
